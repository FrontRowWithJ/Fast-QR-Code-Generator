# Fast-QR-Code-Generator
Fast-QR-Code-Generator is a Webassembly backend and javascript front end that generates qr codes quickly and supports ISO/IEC 8859 8-bit character encoding.

##Prerequisites
A browser that supports Webassembly
If you are using an older browser, I recommend checking if the webassembly flag of your browser is set correctly.
For a simple server application, I recommend Python SimpleHTTPServer

##Getting Started
Clone the project to your specified directory.
Start a http server in the same directory. For example, run the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`.
Open your web browser to your specified uri. If you use the example provided it would be localhost:8080
